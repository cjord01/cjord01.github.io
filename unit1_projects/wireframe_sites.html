		<h1><strong>Site vs. Wireframe</strong></h1>
		<h2>Svpply</h2>
			<p>
				This site is trying to cleanly display currently tending products. At the same time, the site has to make it clear how to easily navigate to categories in a way that does not distract from the products. Easier said than done. The site achieves this through the subtle use of color.

		<h2>Vimeo</h2>
			<p>
				The video is the star here. It is front and center with the vitals simply displayed below. To the top the site displays logos and other art that gives the site an over all cool, hip feel. The site could be more plain with just the video but the titling adds a lot to the site in my opinion. I would compare this to the difference between walking into an Urban Outfitters vs. walking into a K-Mart. At K-Mart there isn&#8217t much to the display; just product on racks. Urban Outfitters has a consistent, hip feel that adds to the experience and brand even if the actual product isn&#8217t any different. I think that YouTube has made great strides in the last few years but I still prefer the look and feel of Vimeo. To the bottom we see thumbnails of other tending videos that the user will hopefully click through and continue to engage with the site.

		<h2>VHX</h2>
			<p>
				I like the use of icons here. VHX is a product for creators who need distribution and marketing of their video products. In a sense, VHX is more of a B2B product. Consumers do not go to this site to find content. VHX provides their tools to the creator who builds their own platform. The goal here is to quickly and simply convey what VHX can do for the creator. This is done mainly through the icons with addition light copy.
