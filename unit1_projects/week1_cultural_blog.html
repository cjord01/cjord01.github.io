		<h3>
			How I got here. 
		</h3>
		<p>
			I have a bachelors in marketing and worked for a marketing agency for six years. Even though I wasn’t necessarily happy, I always just figured, “Well, it’s better than most jobs.” At times it could be a lot of fun but the pay wasn’t great and it never really felt like it was going anywhere. I would look at the people in the positions a step or two above me and think, “I don’t want their job.” They seemed stressed out all the time and they couldn’t have been making that much more than me. It just didn’t seem worth it. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I knew I needed to change directions but the longer you’re on a particular path, the harder that seems. In February I was laid off which was more of a relief than anything. I needed a change but wasn’t initially thinking anything too drastic. My plan was to take my time and find a job that was still in marketing but just different enough that I could find contentment. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			I wanted to maximize all this free time so I sat down and wrote out all the things I planned to do. One of those things was to study coding for an hour a day. I had no plans at the time to pursue a career as a developer. I just knew that it was becoming an increasingly more essential skill and I kept envisioning myself twenty years in the future where not knowing how to code would be like not knowing how to use email. 
		</p>
		<p>
			An hour a day quickly led to three hours a day. Then a friend of mine started telling me about how his roommate was doing something called Dev Bootcamp in lieu of a masters in computer science. I did a little research and started to think that this was exactly what I was looking for.

		<h3>
			The DBC format. 
		</h3>
		<p>
			I really liked the way DBC was set up. It just made sense to me. I always felt like I learned very little from my college experience. Since then I’ve learned a number of other stills, hobbies, etc. that I picked up mostly from intense self-study. This seemed to work much better for me than the traditional education experience. So an intense, guided program felt like a good fit.

		<h3>
			Anxiety. 
		</h3>
		<p>
			I was a little hesitant at first. It was a big investment and what if it didn’t pan out? I always did pretty well in school but the one area I struggled the most with was Spanish. I just couldn’t grasp it and always felt like I couldn’t keep up. Isn’t coding supposed to be like learning a language? What if this ends up being just like when I was in high school and trying to learn Spanish? What if I just can’t keep up?
		</p>
		<p>
			I appreciate how Shereef addressed this a bit in the video because it’s something that hasn’t left my mind. But then again, it’s something that everyone else who’s also taking this leap of fair has to be dealing with too.

		<h3>
			Is this a scam?
		</h3>
		<p>
			That’s a good question Shereef. $12,000 is a lot of money and I had to borrow most of it. This was the question I kept getting as I approached family members. Most people have the traditional education system so deeply drilled into their minds that it’s hard for them to open up to this very different approach. BUT… at this point I have no proof that it will work for me. I’m just going off of my own faith that this is a better approach. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Hmm… Maybe this is a scam. I hope not. I guess we’ll find out soon enough.
