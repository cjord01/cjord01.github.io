				<p>
					Searching for Vince is a feature length film about the life of artist Vincent van Gogh. The story follows Van Gogh&#39s development as an artist and his eventual collapse into mental illness. The twist is that the story is set in present day. The script is based on the 1,000 letters that Van Gogh wrote or received throughout his art career. Approaching letter writing as the 19th century&#39s equivalent to social media, the story is partially told through modern day communication tools and networking platforms.
