			<h3>
				Peer Pairing & Feedback
			</h3>
			<p>
				For the most part I&#39ve really enjoyed the pairing experience. Initially I was surprised to hear that pairing was a common practice in coding. Now that I&#39ve had some experience with it I can see how its a more productive approach. There are times when I&#39m working along, hit something I don&#39t understand, and I&#39ll be stuck there for hours. When pairing, my partner will often save the day and we&#39re able to blast through the obstacle and keep moving forward.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&#39ve been somewhat surprised at how strong the communication has been in most pairing sessions. Programmers aren&#39t known for their amazing interpersonal skills. We&#39re breaking stereotypes here guys. I&#39ve found that most partners have been easy to get along with, patient, and knowledgeable. Most have been willing and able to help me better understand concepts that I&#39m not completely clear on. This has allowed me to get a lot more out of pairing sessions than when I work independently. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The most useful piece of feedback that I&#39ve received is that I withdrew when I didn&#39t seem to understand the code. I would agree that this is true. In many of the pairing sessions I&#39ve been a little intimidated by my partner&#39s coding knowledge. I often feel like others have a better understanding of the material. There have been times when I&#39ve felt so out of my league that my instinct was to just get out of the way. This is not the right approach. I should be better utilizing these opportunities to ask questions and see if my partner can breakdown the code for me. This is something I will be more aware of moving forward.
