			<h3>Jobs in Web Development</h3>
			<h4>Is it really as great as it seems or is this too good to be true?</h4>
			<p>
				I think writing code is important. I think it&#39s something I can enjoy and something that I can be good at in time. But getting into web development was more of a means to an end than a passion. I had started another career years ago that didn&#39t seem to be going anywhere. I needed to try something else and every other article I read points to learning how to write code. From what I could tell, there were all these great companies with all these great jobs and not enough people to fill them. I thought, &#34SIGN ME UP!&#34 
			</p>
			<p>
				So I um... signed up. 
			</p>
			<p> 
				I&#39m excited about it. I tell people about it. I&#39m very optimistic about it, but others seem less convinced. It simply seems too good to be true. Is it? 
			</p>
			<p>
				The career of Web Developer is said to be the ninth best job in America just behind Physician. You know Physician? That job where after four years of college you go and do four years of med-school followed by four more years of residency all while racking up something like half a million dollars in loans. So of course the next best job would be something you can get after only nine weeks of training. OK, yes, my &#34too good to be true&#34 alarm is starting to go off. How can this be possible? 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 20% employment growth for Web Developers between 2012 and 2022. That&#39s around 170,000 developer jobs in total. That&#39s a lot of jobs and there simply aren&#39t enough people with the skills to fill them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And that&#39s exactly why something like DBC can exist. Coding is often compared to learning a language so let&#39s take the metaphor a little further. Let&#39s say you need to hire a translator who speaks Spanish. Who would you rather hire - someone who grew up speaking English but then majored in Spanish at Harvard, or someone who is a first generation American who&#39s been speaking Spanish their entire life? My point is that I wouldn&#39t care where you learned the language. I just care that you can speak it and speak it well. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A few years ago I would have thought that the only way to learn to program would have been to go do a masters in Computer Science. That&#39s not something that I would have been interested in. But spending a couple months completely immersed in the world of coding seems like a better approach. I&#39d even bet that the amount of time spent coding at DBC is comparable to a two year program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I estimate that by the end of DBC I will have spent around 1,500 hours on this stuff once you factor in phase 0 and the prep time prior to that. If you subscribe to the Malcolm Gladwell theory of the 10,000 hour rule which says that at 10,000 hours you will be a world class master at your trade, then 1,500 hours sounds like it&#39s at least enough to be as Shereef says, &#34a world class beginner.&#34 It has to at least be enough to get a job. Especially if that job is in an industry that appears to be scrambling to fill positions.
