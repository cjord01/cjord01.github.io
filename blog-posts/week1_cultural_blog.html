			<h3>
				How I got here. 
			</h3>
			<p>
				I have a bachelors in marketing and worked for a marketing agency for six years. Even though I wasn&#39t necessarily happy, I always just figured, &#34Well, it&#39s better than most jobs.&#34 At times it could be a lot of fun but the pay wasn&#39t great and it never really felt like it was going anywhere. I would look at the people in the positions a step or two above me and think, &#34I don&#39t want their job.&#34 They seemed stressed out all the time and they couldn&#39t have been making that much more than me. It just didn&#39t seem worth it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I knew I needed to change directions but the longer you&#39re on a particular path, the harder that seems. In February I was laid off which was more of a relief than anything. I needed a change but wasn&#39t initially thinking anything too drastic. My plan was to take my time and find a job that was still in marketing but just different enough that I could find contentment. 
			</p>
			<p> 
				I wanted to maximize all this free time so I sat down and wrote out all the things I planned to do. One of those things was to study coding for an hour a day. I had no plans at the time to pursue a career as a developer. I just knew that it was becoming an increasingly more essential skill and I kept envisioning myself twenty years in the future where not knowing how to code would be like not knowing how to use email. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An hour a day quickly led to three hours a day. Then a friend of mine started telling me about how his roommate was doing something called Dev Bootcamp in lieu of a masters in computer science. I did a little research and started to think that this was exactly what I was looking for. 
			</p>

			<h3>
				The DBC format. 
			</h3>
			<p>
				I really liked the way DBC was set up. It just made sense to me. I always felt like I learned very little from my college experience. Since then I&#39ve learned a number of other stills, hobbies, etc. that I picked up mostly from intense self-study. This seemed to work much better for me than the traditional education experience. So an intense, guided program felt like a good fit.

			</p>

			<h3>
				Anxiety. 
			</h3>
			<p>
				I was a little hesitant at first. It was a big investment and what if it didn&#39t pan out? I always did pretty well in school but the one area I struggled the most with was Spanish. I just couldn&#39t grasp it and always felt like I couldn&#39t keep up. Isn&#39t coding supposed to be like learning a language? What if this ends up being just like when I was in high school and trying to learn Spanish? What if I just can&#39t keep up?
			</p>
			<p>
				I appreciate how Shereef addressed this a bit in the video because it&#39s something that hasn&#39t left my mind. But then again, it&#39s something that everyone else who&#39s also taking this leap of fair has to be dealing with too. 

			</p>
			<p>
			</p>
			<p>
			</p>

			<h3>
				Is this a scam?
			</h3>
			<p>
				That&#39s a good question Shereef. $12,000 is a lot of money and I had to borrow most of it. This was the question I kept getting as I approached family members. Most people have the traditional education system so deeply drilled into their minds that it&#39s hard for them to open up to this very different approach. BUT... at this point I have no proof that it will work for me. I&#39m just going off of my own faith that this is a better approach. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hmm... Maybe this is a scam. I hope not. I guess we&#39ll find out soon enough.
