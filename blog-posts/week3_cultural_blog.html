				<em>Week #3: Cultural Blog </em>
			</h2>

			<h3>My thinking style is Abstract Sequencial.</h3>
			<p>
				Abstract Sequential means that I like analyzing situations before making a decision and applying logic in solving problems. I learn best when I have access to experts or references and when working alone. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The access to experts and references part is what attracted me to DBC. I spoke with a few developer friends before applying and my main question was &#34can I really learn to write code in such a short period of time?&#34 The answer I got was pretty surprising. Not only did they all say it was absolutely possible but they all recommended not doing DBC and just learning it all on my own. This might be possible but I knew that the amount of information and resources available is nearly infinite so I knew I would get overwhelmed by the many possible directions I could go in. I went ahead with DBC because it meant that DBC could direct me to the information that was most relevant. This would streamline the process for me and allow me to learn what I needed to learn in a shorter period of time. This is well worth the price of tuition in my opinion. 
			</p>
			<p> 
				Being forced to work with others is probably the part that I will struggle with the most. I feel like I work well with others as far as getting along. The problem I have is that I&#39ve always been very self-reliant and this is something that is a value to me. That means that I struggle with relying on others to get their part of the project done. My psychologist girlfriend (and Freud) would tell you it&#39s because my mother wasn&#39t reliable enough, ha. I&#39ve struggled a bit with finding partners to pair with. This is the variable of phase 0 that gives me the most anxiety because it makes it more difficult to plan out my week and work load. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So far time management has been what has helped me get through everything. I&#39m lucky because DBC is all that I have going on right now so I have plenty of time to work on everything (my heart goes out to those who are still working full time and trying to get through everything). To date, I&#39ve been working very diligently at the start of each week to get my pairing sessions scheduled and to target the challenges that I can get through on my own (like finishing both blog posts by Tuesday). So far so good.
