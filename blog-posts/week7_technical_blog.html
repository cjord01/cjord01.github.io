			<h3>
				SQL vs. NoSQL
			</h3>
			<p>
				What this is really comparing is relational databases versus non-relational databases. Non-relational databases are a relatively new thing. They were first developed in the 2000s while relational databases have been around since the 1970s. The main advantages of non-relational databases (NoSQL) is that they are more scaleable and provide better performance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Here&#39s how they work:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>SQL</strong> - The data is stored by rows and columns just like a spreadsheet. Data can be stored in multiple spreadsheets and these spreadsheets can be linked together so that you can pull data from multiple spreadsheets at the same time.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>NoSQL</strong> - Do away with the table-and-row model and store all relevant data together in a single &#39document&#39. NoSQL databases work in several different formats. The simplest NoSQL databases store data in a &#39key-value&#39 format. To a Ruby user it&#39s basically a hash. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p> 
				SQL databases are vertically scalable while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that SQLs are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware while NoSQLs are scaled by increasing the database&#39s servers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A draw back to relational databases (SQL) is that they have to be taken offline in order to alter the database. Non-relational databases (NoSQL) are more dynamic and new information can be added on the fly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another argument against relational databases is that they can slow down the system. That&#39s why companies with millions of users like Google have developed their own non-relational systems. The counter argument is that you, whoever you are, are not as big as Google and will not be searching as much data as Google. Additionally, relational databases have evolved in recent years and are much more powerful than they used to be.
