				Asking good questions
			</h3>
			<p>
				I&#39m not sure I agree with the adage that &#34there&#39s no such thing as a dumb question.&#34 Sometimes there are dumb questions and those are often the questions that come from laziness. These are the questions that people don&#39t want to try and answer themselves. They&#39d prefer to just have someone else do the work for them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I&#39ve found that the most important part of asking good questions when it comes to programming is to first do your due diligence and make sure the question hasn&#39t already been asked and answered. Nearly every problem I&#39ve come across while learning to program was able to be solved simply by looking online. Sometimes it&#39s not always a simple, easy to find answer, but most of the time it is out there. Be thorough. Take the time to make sure the answer it&#39s right in front of you.
			</p>
			<p> 
				If you feel like you&#39ve tried as much as you can and need to pose the question, make sure you&#39re providing every bit of information that would be needed. If you try to put the burden on the people trying to help you then you&#39re being lazy. If they have to do work to answer your question then they&#39re less likely to answer your question. Help them help you. Be thorough in your question and provide all the tools and information needed so that someone with the required knowledge can step in and solve your problem as easily as possible.
