			<h3>
				Values
			</h3>
			<p>
				There are quite a few themes and words here that feel somewhat synonymous to me, so I&#39m going to break them into groups and talk about each group individually.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before I get into the values I&#39ll start with something I heard many years ago that has stuck with me. All problems that you can have in life can be boiled down to three things - health, wealth, and relationships. Knowing this, I have always tried to take small steps everyday to keep those aspects of my life in check. If you can keep those three things covered then that will free you up to pursue the goals that really matter to you. So let&#39s start there...
			</p>
			<h3>
				Efficiency, Stability, and Economic security
			</h3>
			<p> 
				To me, these three values mostly relate to wealth. I&#39m sure that when most people read the word &#39wealth&#39 they think the solution is to make as much money as possible. I disagree. Economic security doesn&#39t necessarily mean you need to be rich. It really just comes down to efficiently managing what you have. I&#39ve found that one secret to life is this - Low Overhead. Most people spend more money as they make more money so they never really achieve the stability and security that they long for. Their personal empire grows over time and the pressure to maintain that empire comes along with it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal is stability and economic security, and in my opinion the easiest way to get there is through efficiency. I&#39m constantly asking myself what it is that I truly need and what are the things I can live without. We have infinite wants but the cost that comes with obtaining those wants is more than just the dollars spent. There is a lot of stress that comes with maintaining your empire so practice restraint and you&#39ll live a happier more fulfilled life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I don&#39t need a boat, a sports car, and a mansion. My personal mantra is this - &#34Well traveled, well read, well dressed, well fed.&#34 These are the things that bring the most richness and pleasure to my life. If I can just earn enough income to check off these boxes then I&#39m good. The rest of my time and energy is spent maintaining relationships, taking care of myself, and pursuing personal goals. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Control, Freedom, Independence, and Self-reliance
			</h3>
			<p>
				This might seem counter intuitive but for me at least, a key to maintaining relationships is to minimize them. The time and energy that you possess is finite. You can&#39t be everyone&#39s best friend. I think it&#39s better to have fewer, deeper relationships then to have many, surface relationships. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Not all relationships are built simply from a point of mutual respect. Many relationships stem from a place of dependancy. You can have more control over your life and feel a sense of freedom by creating a life of independence and self-reliance where the relationships you have are based on common interests and respect. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Challenge, Commitment, Growth, and Personal development
			</h3>
			<p>
				With the essentials covered, you&#39re free to pursue the goals that are meaningful to you. For me, all I ever really wanted was to be great at something. I have not achieved that yet but I have a number of pursuits in my life which I spend time on everyday; slowly chipping away at and making incremental progress with on a daily basis. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For many of these things I might not see any return on investment for another 20 years if ever. And it they never really pan out, well, that&#39s OK with me too. That commitment to challenging myself everyday and pushing myself to grow and develop is it&#39s own reward. I find fulfillment in all of these pursuits. Looking back on where I was and where I am now gives me a sense of pride.
