			<em>Week #1: Evaluating Websites</em>
		</h2>

		<h3>
			1. <a href="https://svpply.com/shop/categories" title= "First Site">Svpply</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Svpply is a social shopping site that enables users to register and start keeping track of products that they like.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a site I frequent daily to find interesting products and designs. The site is somewhat similar to Pinterest but simpler and narrower in focus. I find that the content displayed is often inline with my own taste vs. Pinterest which seems to be watered down and less curated. There really isn’t much to the site because there doesn’t have to be. The products are what is important and what grabs your attention. The site is simple, clean, timeless, and elegant. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The site is a great tool for discovering new products (mostly fashion and home-furnishings). The content is uploaded from popular sites and boutiques and voted up based on a like system. The site updates every 10 minutes with the currently trending products. The site is addictive and inspiring. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I love the ‘shop’ page which lists columns three products deep and ranked by ‘wants’. These lists can also be broken down into sub-categories. One gripe I have is that then you click over to the stores/friends you are following, the products turn into a single column ranked by most recently uploaded. This means that you’ll normally have to scroll through dozens of similar products from the same store. This could be a great area of the site but I tend not to use it for this reason. 
		</p>

		<h3>
			2. <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks" title= "Second Site">Vimeo</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Vimeo is a video sharing platform that allows users to upload, share and view high-definition videos. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I like to think of Vimeo as YouTube with class. There are several things that Vimeo does that give it this integrity.
		</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Vimeo has a “be nice” policy where if you post rude, non-constructive comments then they just block you from the site. </li>
				<li>Vimeo also doesn’t lead with the view count. On YouTube people tend not to want to watch anything that doesn’t already have millions of views. Vimeo’s format forces your immediate reaction to the video to be based purely on content. </li>
			</ol>
		<p>
			Vimeo is a great place for finding actual filmmaking. The quality you find on Vimeo compared to YouTube is like comparing a reality TV show to a premium cable drama. YouTube has done a great job of cleaning up and redesigning the ascetics of their site but I would still give Vimeo the edge. Something about it’s playing has a more premium feel like you’re watching something important. YouTube will always have a trashy, disposable feel. 
		</p>

		<h3>
			3. <a href="https://www.vhx.tv" title= "Third Site">VHX</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			VHX is an online digital distribution platform helping independent artists sell video content and connect with their fans.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am also a filmmaker of sorts and have been working the last few years to produce my own feature length film. Digital cameras have some a long way over the last five years and have really changed the way films are made. The other side of the equation is the way in which films are distributed. The battle is still on but my favorite direct-to-consumer site to emerge is VHX. 

		</p>
		<p>
			VHX allows you to sell your content directly to your fans for a reasonable fee. They give you a lot of tools like ability to adjust the price, streaming and downloading options, site design, mercy, crowd funding, etc. It’s sort of a one stop shop that allows the filmmaker to concentrate on the important part, making the film.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are several competitors who can offer similar features but I trust VHX the most largely because of how elegantly designed their website is. There is a very polished, pro-feel that makes me feel like I’m in good hands. When distributing an indie film, there isn’t much money for anything. VHX gives you the tools to pass along that polished, pro-feel to your potential fans/customers.
